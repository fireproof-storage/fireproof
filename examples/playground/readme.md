# esbuild react starter

![](rocket.gif)

A super simple starter using react and esbuild

Including handy presets:

- Live reload dev server using servor + esbuild watch
- Automatic import of react in .jsx files
- Minified build

"npm run start" for a live reloading dev server using esbuild's watch and servor with no minifying + sourcemap
"npm run build" for the minified production build.
