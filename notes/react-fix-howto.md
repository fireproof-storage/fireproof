# React Hooks Testing Issues and Fixes

## Problem Overview

We've identified several critical issues with our React hooks implementation and testing approach that are causing test failures and browser crashes:

1. **Infinite Update Loops**: The current React hooks implementation can cause infinite update loops when used in combination with certain patterns, particularly when state updates trigger effects that cause more state updates.

2. **Maximum Update Depth Exceeded**: This error appears when React detects too many consecutive state updates without completing a render cycle, usually due to state updates in useEffect that trigger more useEffect runs.

3. **Race Conditions**: There are race conditions between `save()` and `reset()` operations, especially when they are called in the same tick without proper awaiting.

4. **Improper Test Isolation**: Tests are affecting each other due to shared state and lacking proper cleanup.

5. **Missing act() Wrappers**: React updates are not properly wrapped in `act()`, causing React to warn about updates during testing that might lead to inconsistent UI.

## Root Causes

### 1. Document Hook Implementation Issues

In `fixed-hooks.ts`, the `useFireproofDocument` hook has the following issues:

- The subscriptions to database changes can cause infinite loops in certain scenarios
- The initial document reference can change between renders, causing unnecessary re-renders
- Race conditions between save/reset methods are not properly handled

### 2. Testing Approach Problems

- Tests are not properly isolated
- Missing proper `act()` wrappers for state updates
- Not properly handling async React updates
- Trying to test race conditions that actually crash the browser

## How to Fix

### Component/Hook Fixes

1. **Stabilize References**:
   - Use React.useRef for initial document values to prevent re-rendering
   - Ensure stable references in dependency arrays
   
   ```typescript
   // Bad
   const docResult = useDocument<TestDoc>({ text: "initial" });
   
   // Good
   const initialDocRef = React.useRef<TestDoc>({ text: "initial" });
   const docResult = useDocument<TestDoc>(initialDocRef.current);
   ```

2. **Fix Race Conditions**:
   - Add a flag in the hook implementation to track if an update happened via reset()
   - Prevent subscription-based updates from overriding explicit resets
   - Consider adding a queue for operations to ensure order

3. **Better Effect Dependencies**:
   - Ensure useEffect dependency arrays are correct and minimal
   - Use reference equality rather than shallow equality for complex objects

### Testing Fixes

1. **Proper act() Usage**:
   - Wrap ALL state updates in `act()`
   - Include awaiting promises inside act() blocks
   
   ```typescript
   // Bad
   docResult.merge({ input: "new" });
   await waitFor(() => expect(docResult.doc.input).toBe("new"));
   
   // Good
   await act(async () => {
     docResult.merge({ input: "new" });
   });
   expect(docResult.doc.input).toBe("new");
   ```

2. **Test Isolation**:
   - Use unique database names for each test
   - Properly clean up in afterEach()
   - Use React.useRef in test components

3. **Race Condition Testing**:
   - Skip problematic tests using `it.skip`
   - Break race condition tests into smaller, more focused tests
   - Avoid testing actual race conditions - test the behavior boundaries instead

## Implementation Plan

1. Fix the core hooks in `fixed-hooks.ts`:
   - Add flags to track reset vs save state
   - Stabilize document references
   - Fix subscription logic

2. Update tests:
   - Add proper act() wrappers
   - Fix beforeEach setup to use refs
   - Skip or fix race condition tests
   - Add explicit timeouts

3. Regression testing:
   - Test basic hooks functionality
   - Test edge cases carefully
   - Ensure browser isn't crashing
