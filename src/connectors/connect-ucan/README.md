## Fireproof UCAN connector

[UCAN](https://ucan.xyz) is a distributed auth protocol that Fireproof Cloud uses to implement access control.

Read more about [UCAN delegation](https://fission.codes/blog/verifying-ucans/) which gives devs and end-users control over capabilites.

For application users, Fireproof auth will work via familiar channels like email and passkey.

This connector is "under construction" -- please [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/cCryrNHePH) to let us know how you'd like to use it.
